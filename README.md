##Setup
###Python Requirements:
    
    pip install evernote

###Configuration:
You will need to edit the `PATH_TO_ENSCRIPT` variable at the top of everpy_cli.py if your ENScript is not in the `C:\Program Files (x86)\Evernote\Evernote\` directory.

You need to get a developer token from Evernote. The first time you run the app you will be prompted for this key.
